# Model Checker Collection for the Model Checking Contest @ Petri nets

The model checker collection is a tool that is built to compete in the
[Model Checking Contest @ Petri nets](https://mcc.lip6.fr)

Its purpose is to allow research on the algorithm that will choose
the best tool, depending on the model, examination and formula characteristics.
